# Preface

One of the greatest blessings on humans is the grace of mind, leaving this grace without any care or expansion of it will lead it to decay and fragility, which will force its owner to hand over (either willingly or not) his mind to others to lead him as they wish. Just like a blind sheep follow a herd of other blind sheep who follows the command of the shepherd.
